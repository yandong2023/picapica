A simple **web-based photo booth** application built with **React** that captures images using a webcam, applies filters, and generates a downloadable photo strip!

### Where did the name come from?
The name **Picapica** comes from a mix of:
- **"Picture"** - representing photography and capturing moments.
- The **Picapica** is the sound that cameras make.

Just like Pikachu, **Picapica** brings a spark of excitement to your photos! ⚡✨
